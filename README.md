# LAB - 9

## Salmon Cookies

This is a website I built for Pat where we used constructor functions to track his hourly and total cookie sales at his five locations. I then used a these same functions to render the data into HTML elements and on to our sales.html doc.

I added CSS functionality to the index.html webpage with custom images from the client.

During lab 9 I used the DOM EventListener to attach an event to a specified element of html. In this case, I created a form where the user could input specific variables for a new cookie store and using these user submitted values, add to and adjust the respective table accordingly.

### Reflections and Comments

- For the most part this lab went well, the biggest issue was adjusting the footer to include the newly added values.

- I learned that we can use a method to remove an element, and then run another method to replace that element.
