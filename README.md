# LAB - 10b

## Salmon Cookies

This is a website I built for Pat where we used constructor functions to track his hourly and total cookie sales at his five locations. I then used a these same functions to render the data into HTML elements and on to our sales.html doc.

I added CSS functionality to the index.html webpage with custom images from the client.

During lab 9 I used the DOM EventListener to attach an event to a specified element of html. In this case, I created a form where the user could input specific variables for a new cookie store and using these user submitted values, add to and adjust the respective table accordingly.

For lab 10 I am adding custom google font for the title, a sans-serif font for data, and a serif font for my text. I am also changing the color of the text for each font type.

### Reflections and Comments

- This part of the lab I was just adding finishing touches. I learned that we can use a custom google font with a link in order for the font to be implemented on any browser.
