## Salmon Cookies

This is a website I built for Pat where we used constructor functions to track his hourly and total cookie sales at his five locations. I then used a these same functions to render the data into HTML elements and on to our sales.html doc.

I added CSS functionality to the index.html webpage with custom images from the client.

### Reflections and Comments

- CSS is hard. I am still having issues selecting specific elements without the use of class or ID.

- I find myself jumping around when I am trying to write CSS, when I need to instead start from the top left and break it down from there.
